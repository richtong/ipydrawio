# Making Diagrams

IPyDrawio lets you build and interact with diagram [documents] compatible with
[diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net), or hosted drawio integrations in
Confluence and other tools.

The same renderer powers different kinds of Jupyter outputs, including Jupyter
[rich displays] and [widgets].

[documents]: ../Diagram%20Document.ipynb
[rich displays]: ../Diagram%20Rich%20Display.ipynb
[widgets]: ../Diagram%20Widget.ipynb

```{toctree}
../Diagram Document
../Diagram Rich Display
../Diagram Widget
```
