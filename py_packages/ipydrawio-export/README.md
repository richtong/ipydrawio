See the [project repo](https://github.com/deathbeds/ipydrawio) for more
information.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ipydrawio-export
```

## Server Extension

`ipydrawio-export` runs as a [server extension][serverext]. When installed, it
_should_ be automatically configured. If problems arise, it can be manually
_enabled_:

```bash
jupyter server extension list   # If you don't see it here...
jupyter server extension enable --sys-prefix --py ipydrawio_export  # run this...
jupyter server extension list   # ... then check it again
```

> Note: If you are starting your server with `jupyter notebook` (not
> `jupyter lab`), the commands above will be `serverextension` instead of
> `server extension`!

## Command-Line Usage

### Exporting PDF

PDF can also be generated from the command line:

```bash
pip install ipydrawio-export
jupyter drawio-export pdf some_file.dio
```

If needed, the `nodejs` application will be installed into the Jupyter data
path.

```bash
jupyter config --paths  # it uses the one in the environment
```

> In the future, it's hoped this can be packaged more conveniently.

### Provisioning

To ensure the `nodejs` application is installed _without_ exporting a PDF (e.g
when building a `docker` container).

```bash
jupyter ipydrawio-export provision
```

### Provision locations

If defined, these environment variables will be respected, and an
`ipydrawio_export` folder will be created:

- `$JUPYTER_DATA_DIR`
- `$IPYDRAWIO_DATA_DIR`

Otherwise, `ipydrawio-export` will provision its files into
`{sys.prefix}/ipydrawio_export`.

Of note:

- access to the internet is required
- this location must be writeable by the user
- there must be about 400MiB available, primarily for `puppeteer`'s `chromium`
